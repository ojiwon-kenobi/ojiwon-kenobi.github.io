I took an ethics class as a high schooler (yes, my high school had an ethics class), and I remember liking the class a lot. We had to do this debate (I don't remember the topic) in the class using the concepts we learned. Whoever won could nominate a non-profit organization for which the instructor would make a donation. I didn't win, but the high-schooler-me had gotten overly excited and a bit aggressive, enough that the instructor had to quietly call me out on it. Another thing I remember vividly, is discussing the trolley problem. 
I don't really remember anything else. I guess the biggest takeaway for me at the time, was that there exists a study for 'right' and 'wrong'. Dictionary.com provides a better definition for ethics: "That branch of philosophy dealing with values relating to human conduct, with respect to the rightness and wrongness of certain actions and to the goodness and badness of the motives and ends of such actions." 

I fell down the philosophy-ethics-rabbit-hole a couple of weeks ago (aka January 2021). Like most, I don't like being wrong, and hate situations when I can't logically explain my choices. So far, all the decisions I have made have been relatively easy ones- Between x, y, and z, which is better? 
Then, a friend introduced me to the field of BCIs (brain-computer interfaces), and the idea of being able to control things with your mind, even control your mind itself, got me pondering the harder decisions- Between x, y, and z, what is right? 

### Theories of Morality
* Moral Subjectivism: <em>You</em> decide what is right or wrong.
* Cultural Relativism: It depends on what the norm is at the time.
* Ethical Egoism: If it serves your self-interest, it is right. If it's not, then it is immoral.
* Divine Command Theory: Listen to God. (...the src does say this theory has serious flaws)
* Virtue Ethics: Whatever makes a good person is right.
* Feminist Ethics/ Masculine Ethics: Gender plays a role in discerning right from wrong.
* Utilitarianism: Overall utility determined by the consequences of an action discerns right from wrong.
* Kantian Theory: Right and wrong is determined by the consequences.  (Also known as neo-consequentialist moral theory)
* Rights-based theories: If people have rights, then everybody must do their duty to uphold those rights.
* Contractarianism: Through social contract, right and wrong is decided. (Social contract = An implicit agreement between the individuals and the state/nation where the individual cooperates with society for social benefits)

### Philosophical idea 
* Absurdism: People want a purpose in life, but nobody actually has the ability to find that purpose.
* Acosmism: Reality is an illusion.
* Agnosticism: We'll never know if the divine/ higher power/ God exists.
* Anarchism: Authority and hierarchy suck.
* Anatta (Buddism): 'I' do not exist.
* Anti-humanism: Human nature is ever changing. It has no definition.
* Antinatalism: Procreation is wrong (aka: being alive is pain, why would you bring another human into this world) (...somebody was not having a good day)
* Apatheism: I don't care if God exists or not. (Diderot: "It is very important not to mistake hemlock for parsley, but to believe or not believe in God is not important at all)
* Apathy: i dont care
* Cosmicism: There is no divine presence, and we humans are all insignificant.
* Cynicism: Reject material wealth and you shall be free.
* Dysteleology: We just sorta happened. We weren't created because somebody was bored, or wanted us to do grand things.
* Rational egoism: You're rational if you act on your own self-interest. 
* Eliminative materialism: 
* Existentialism: Only you decide your own life and your own existence.
* Hedonism: We are driven by the desire to increase pleasure and decrease pain. 
* Legal nihilism: Law doesn't just suck, it's destructive.
* Misanthropy: Humanity sucks.
* Misotheism: God sucks.
* Moral nihlism: There is no such thing as right or wrong.
* Nihilism: We're all gonna die anyways.
* Pessimism: Life sucks. Evil will prevail over Good.
* Postmodernism: We should not focus on binary narratives, nor pre-existing concepts (kind of like anti-humanism, except that it's not like the narrative changes. There is no narrative to change.)
* Structralism:  You need to know different elements of human culture 
* Radical skepticism: 
* Solipsism: I am real.
* Trivialism: Everything is true in its own right.

There's not actually any purpose
