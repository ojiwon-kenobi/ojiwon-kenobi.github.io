Autoencoder: used for dimensionality reduction- which is literally the process that reduces the dimension of input data. By reducing the number of features available in input data, performance increases. Autoencoders allow us to get the barebone of the inputs, removing unnecessary bloat (or misleading data) from the input. This gives us the advantage of improving model accuracy because there's less bloat to impact our feature extraction, performance improvement and lower space complexity thanks to less data, and less dimensions means we can play around with more algorithms (there are algorithsm out there that can't handle large dimensions such as k-means clustering), and remove redundancy and noise.
