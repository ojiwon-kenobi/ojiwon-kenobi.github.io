I"Ý<p>I took an ethics class as a high schooler (yes, my high school had an ethics class), and I remember liking the class a lot. We had to do this debate (I donâ€™t remember the topic) in the class using the concepts we learned. Whoever won could nominate a non-profit organization for which the instructor would make a donation. I didnâ€™t win, but the high-schooler-me had gotten overly excited and a bit aggressive, enough that the instructor had to quietly call me out on it. Another thing I remember vividly, is discussing the trolley problem. 
I donâ€™t really remember anything else. I guess the biggest takeaway for me at the time, was that there exists a study for â€˜rightâ€™ and â€˜wrongâ€™. Wikipedia provides a better</p>
