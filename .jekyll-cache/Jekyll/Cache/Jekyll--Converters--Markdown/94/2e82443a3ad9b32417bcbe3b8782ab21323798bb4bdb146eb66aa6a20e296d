<p>I took an ethics class as a high schooler (yes, my high school had an ethics class), and I remember liking the class a lot. We had to do this debate (I don’t remember the topic) in the class using the concepts we learned. Whoever won could nominate a non-profit organization for which the instructor would donate. I didn’t win, but the high-schooler-me had gotten overly excited and a bit aggressive, enough that the instructor had to quietly call me out on it. Another thing I remember vividly is discussing the trolley problem. 
I don’t remember anything else. I guess the biggest takeaway for me at the time, was that there exists a study for ‘right’ and ‘wrong’. Wikipedia provides a better definition: “/[Ethics/] is a branch of philosophy that “involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong behavior”</p>
