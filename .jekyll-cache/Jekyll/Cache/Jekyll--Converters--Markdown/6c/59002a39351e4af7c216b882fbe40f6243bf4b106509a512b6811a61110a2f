I"<p>Hi ğŸ™‹â€â™€ï¸; my name is Jiwon. At this time, Iâ€™m interested in animating, video editing, brain-computer interfaces, and bioethics (in particular, usage and handling of user health data).
My one goal in life is to never be bored.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s my <a href="../obsolete/index.htm">old website</a>, in case youâ€™re visiting before Iâ€™ve had a chance to update this one.</p>
