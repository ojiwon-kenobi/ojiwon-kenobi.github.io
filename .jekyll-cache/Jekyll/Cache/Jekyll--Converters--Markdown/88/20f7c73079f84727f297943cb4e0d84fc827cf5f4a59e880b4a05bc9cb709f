<p>I took an ethics class as a high schooler (yes, my high school had an ethics class), and I remember liking the class a lot. We had to do this debate (I don’t remember the topic) in the class using the concepts we learned. Whoever won could nominate a non-profit organization for which the instructor would donate. I didn’t win, but the high-schooler-me had gotten overly excited and a bit aggressive, enough that the instructor had to quietly call me out on it. Another thing I remember vividly is discussing the trolley problem. 
I don’t remember anything else. I guess the biggest takeaway for me at the time, was that there exists a study for ‘right’ and ‘wrong’. Wikipedia provides a better definition: “/[Ethics/] is a branch of philosophy that “involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong behavior”</p>

<p>Then I fell down the philosophy-ethics-rabbit-hole a couple of weeks ago (aka January 2021). Like most, I don’t like being wrong and hate situations when I can’t logically explain my choices. So far, all the decisions I have made have been relatively easy ones- Between x, y, and z, which is better? 
Then, a friend introduced me to the field of BCIs (brain-computer interfaces), and the idea of being able to control things with your mind, even control your mind itself, got me pondering the harder decisions- Between x, y, and z, what is right?</p>

<p>About a decade has passed since that ethics class, and I know a few more philosophical views out there, but not much more. I did order a book on bioethics, but since I don’t have Amazon Prime, that’s going to take a couple of weeks to get to my place.</p>

<p>So I consulted the trusty Wikipedia, and here is what I found, and what I got out of it. Philosophy is incredibly complicated, so what I have here is like… an ELI5 of the views I found.</p>

<h3 id="philosophical-idea">Philosophical idea</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Absurdism: People want a purpose in life, but nobody actually has the ability to find that purpose. (Camus is a partypooper)</li>
  <li>Acosmism: Reality is an illusion.</li>
  <li>Agnosticism: We’ll never know if the divine/ higher power/ God exists.</li>
  <li>Anarchism: Authority and hierarchy suck.</li>
  <li>Anatta (Buddism): ‘I’ do not exist.</li>
  <li>Anti-humanism: Human nature is ever-changing. It has no definition.</li>
  <li>Antinatalism: Procreation is wrong (aka: being alive is pain, why would you bring another human into this world) (…somebody was not having a good day)</li>
  <li>Apatheism: I don’t care if God exists or not. (Diderot: “It is very important not to mistake hemlock for parsley, but to believe or not believe in God is not important at all)</li>
  <li>Apathy: i dont care</li>
  <li>Cosmicism: There is no divine presence, and we humans are all insignificant.</li>
  <li>Cynicism: Reject material wealth and you shall be free.</li>
  <li>Dysteleology: We just sorta happened. We weren’t created because somebody was bored or wanted us to do grand things.</li>
  <li>Rational egoism: You’re rational if you act on your self-interest.</li>
  <li>Eliminative materialism:</li>
  <li>Existentialism: Only you decide your own life and your own existence.</li>
  <li>Hedonism: We are driven by the desire to increase pleasure and decrease pain.</li>
  <li>Legal nihilism: Law doesn’t just suck, it’s destructive.</li>
  <li>Misanthropy: Humanity sucks.</li>
  <li>Misotheism: God sucks.</li>
  <li>Moral nihilism: There is no such thing as right or wrong.</li>
  <li>Nihilism: We’re all gonna die anyway.</li>
  <li>Pessimism: Life sucks. Evil will prevail over Good.</li>
  <li>Postmodernism: We should not focus on binary narratives, nor pre-existing concepts (kind of like anti-humanism, except that it’s not like the narrative changes. There is no narrative to change.)</li>
  <li>Structuralism:  You need to know different elements of human culture</li>
  <li>Radical skepticism:</li>
  <li>Solipsism: I am real.</li>
  <li>Trivialism: Everything is true.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="theories-of-morality">Theories of Morality</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Moral Subjectivism: <em>You</em> decide what is right or wrong.</li>
  <li>Cultural Relativism: It depends on what the norm is at the time.</li>
  <li>Ethical Egoism: If it’s for you, it is right. If it’s not, then it is immoral.</li>
  <li>Divine Command Theory: Listen to God. (…the src does say this theory has serious flaws)</li>
  <li>Virtue Ethics: Whatever makes a good person is right.</li>
  <li>Feminist Ethics/ Masculine Ethics: Gender plays a role in discerning right from wrong.</li>
  <li>Utilitarianism: Overall utility determined by the consequences of an action discerns right from wrong.</li>
  <li>Kantian Theory: Right and wrong is determined by the consequences.  (Also known as neo-consequentialist moral theory)</li>
  <li>Rights-based theories: If people have rights, then everybody must do their duty to uphold those rights.</li>
  <li>Contractarianism: Through the social contract, right and wrong are decided. (Social contract = An implicit agreement between the individuals and the state/nation where the individual cooperates with society for social benefits)</li>
</ul>

<p>I guess we could use philosophical ideas as a framework through which we project ideas by supporting them with theories of morality.</p>
