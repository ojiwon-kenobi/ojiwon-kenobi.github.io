I briefly considered making my own theme, but found myself less interested in working on the visual details and interaction of the page than actually getting the blog up. A theme would have all of that already, so I chose to go that route. &lt;br /&gt;
I liked a blog that had a backdrop image, placed posts on the forefront, and was relatively minimal. An available theme that met those criteria was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;amp;q=StartBootstrap%2Fstartbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll+&quot;&gt;StartBootstrap/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll&lt;/a&gt;. I found a Medium article that detailed how to [Create a blog for Jekyll and Github pages] (https://medium.com/20percentwork/creating-your-blog-for-free-using-jekyll-github-pages-dba37272730a) and proceeded to hit the most time consuming step- learning about ruby and gems dependencies because compiles kept failing. &lt;br /&gt;
After consulting like 5 stack overflow posts, I realized there were two versions of ruby installed on my machine, and the wrong one was being referenced each time I tried to compile. I changed the path of the ruby being called so that it led to the more recent version, and then deleted the old version of ruby, which fixed the problem. Once I pulled the gem for the theme I liked and replaced the default jekyll theme with it, and ran &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundle exec jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;.  Setup was instantaneous and the result on my local machine as beautiful. I had this endorphin rush just looking at my pretty blog. &lt;br /&gt;
But then, the site refused to build correctly on github pages. Only the jekyll front matter was showing- it looked like jekyll was not rendering html pages properly as it should be. I thought it might have something to do with the jekyll cache and read from another developer‚Äôs comments that adding an empty &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.nojekyll&lt;/code&gt; file was essential to bypass the cached files. &lt;br /&gt;
So I went for a fix that I did not fully research. Without a clear idea what &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.nojekyll&lt;/code&gt; did, I added that in because of a highly-voted answer that made it sound like githug-pages necessitated the presence of this file and thought of it like a common &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt; file. &lt;br /&gt;
The build still wasn‚Äôt working. After a couple of hours of staring at random posts with keywords such as ‚Äòfront matter‚Äô, ‚Äòjekyll not working‚Äô, ‚Äògithub pages not working‚Äô, I went back to the fundamentals and thoroughly read the actual [GitHub documentation] (‚Äòhttps://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages‚Äô), and in the &lt;em&gt;Static site generator&lt;/em&gt; section which is exactly what my system is, it clearly says&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;GitHub Pages will use Jekyll to build your site by default. If you want to use a static site generator other than Jekyll, disable the Jekyll build process by creating an empty file called .nojekyll in the root of your publishing source, then follow your static site generator‚Äôs instructions to build your site locally. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I needed Jekyll to build my site and had added a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.nojekyll&lt;/code&gt; file which blocks Jekyll from building itü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Now that it‚Äôs removed, my site correctly deploys.
This is the kind of timesink that I have realized I fall into frequently. I run into an error, look for fixes, implement said fixes, fix the original problem but introduce a new problem, and try to fix that. Luckily, this resolved itself quickly. I find that I actually need to confirm that I understand everything about the code that I write. Sometimes, when the problem comes from an unexpected place in a vast system, this takes longer, but that‚Äôs what experience is for. 
In the process of reading through github documentation, I‚Äôve found that the size of my static site is limited (well duh) and I‚Äôll have to find ways to reduce the size of my files continuously. Instead of having static images saved in my assets folder in the repo, I have chosen to link directly to images online so that they get called in the build process, online. I threw all the jekyll cache-related things in the gitignore so that they don‚Äôt get uploaded to the repo. New solutions will have to be found as I continue writing, but that‚Äôs expected of software development.
Anyways, I plan to increase my freedom over the theme by pulling the source code and changing that for the theme itself instead of using the gem. I don‚Äôt want some of the tabs, and I don‚Äôt really like serif font (I‚Äôm ). Actually pulling the code instead of using the gem is likely going to take up more space, but it should work for now.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I started by leafing through random website github repos of software engineers and UX designers, until I found a theme that I liked.
