Hi, there 🙋‍♀️; my name is Jiwon. At this time, I'm interested in animating, video editing, brain-computer interfaces, and bioethics (in particular, usage and handling of user health data).
My one goal in life is to never be bored.

Here's my [old website](../obsolete/index.htm), in case you're visiting before I've had a chance to update this one.
